Step 1 Ask
Business Task
To identify potential opportunities for growth and provide recommendations for the Hotel Strategy Team to improve based on trend.  We have two hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type.  We want to understand if there is a trend of guest bringing personal cars. Focus on average daily rate and guest to explore seasonality.
Key Stakeholders: Jane Doe Chief Financial Officers
Questions:
1.	Is our hotel revenue growing by year?
2.	Should we increase our parking lot size?
3.	What trends can we see in the data?
Step 2 Prepare
The data being used in this case study can be found https://absentdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hotel_revenue_historical_full-2.xlsx.  The data set contain 1 Excel file which contain 2018, 2019, and 2020 hotel reservation stays as well as market segment and meal costs.  
Step 3 Process
The tables were loaded into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.  Taking a look at each data frame to familiarize myself and check for errors.  The data for 2018 is from July-December and is missing 6 months of data. The data for 2020 is January-August of the year and missing 4 months of data.  Combined all three years of reservations and left joined market segment and meal costs into one table for analysis.
Step 4 Analyze
 
Based on a data available a time line of revenue indicates July-September would be the season the most revenue with a significant increase in revenue from the 2018 to 2019 season.  The 2020 monthly revenue has increased verses 2018, 2019 with a slight dip in July and August but nowhere near 2018 which were the lowest of the 3 years.  Base on trends for the remainder of 2020 the revenue should be at or exceed the 2019 revenue.  In regards to the most used parking would be the resort hotels but only at about 3 percent and doesnâ€™t seem to require attention at this time.
